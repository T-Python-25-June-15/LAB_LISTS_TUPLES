## Cinema Booking Program
Create A small cinema program that uses a basic system to track **booked seats** for each show. Each booked seat is represented as a **tuple** of the form `(row_number, seat_number)`, and the full booking list is a **list of these tuples**.

---

### **Description**

You are given a list of booked seats for a movie show. Each seat is represented as a tuple `(row, seat)` where:

* `row` is an integer from 1 to 10
* `seat` is an integer from 1 to 20

Example:

```python
booked_seats = [(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 10), (3, 7), (4, 15)]
```

Write a program that performs the following tasks:

---

### **Tasks**

1. **Display all booked seats** in the format:

   ```
   Row 1, Seat 5  
   Row 1, Seat 6  
   ...
   ```

2. **Check availability:** Ask the user to enter a seat (e.g., row 2, seat 10), and tell them whether the seat is **booked** or **available**.

3. **Add a booking:** ask the user to enter the seat, row . if available, add it to the `booked_seats` list. else display a relevant message.

4. **Cancel a booking:** Ask the user to enter a row & a seat to cancel. If it's in the list, remove it.

5. **Print all booked seats, sorted by row and then seat**.

6. **Calculate and display**:

   * Total number of booked seats
   * Number of seats booked per row (use a list of counts for each row index 0â€“9)

### Note:
The program when run should run and displays a menu that asks the user what he/she wants to do based on the above tasks, and only exits if the user types in "exit".

---

### **Constraints**

* Use only **lists and tuples**.
